Hello! The repository builds on Nimbella and is based on the use case story off of the daily 15 minute meetings that many companies do. During agile/scrum development, companies will have a 15 minute meeting when they start off. They discuss what has been done so far, what will be worked on today, and what possible blockers may be. This meeting is helpful, but after a short while, it is easy to forget information about what happened in the meeting. Additionally, some people may have not been able to attend the meeting. Then comes these convenient slack commands, as it enables people to write bullet list points for what has been done, what needs to be worked on today, and what possible blockers may be. This helps people make better decisions, be more informed, and improve productivity.
